      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

      <h1>MY STORY</h1>
      <h3>Unfortunately. I have had to work pretty hard at being happy. I am not sure if itâ€™s my genetics or my past mental issues, but by default, I tend to be a pessimistic and an anxious-type of person.As a kid ,I was extremely timid and shy. I have had to develop the discipline of applying specific happiness-tools daily to keep myself upbeat.</h3>
      <h3>Being happy has not been easy for me. I have had to learn strategies and work hard at them. I know that if I can do it, so can you. Don't let the present circumstances of your life(no matter how bad they are) or the past traumas stop you from finding happiness. There is magic in living in positive states. I have also discovered in my life that once you commit to being happy, things around you start changing.</h3>
